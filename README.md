### Built with

### What I learned

Mobile first workflow - Easier to build with Mobile in mind first then work up to the Desktop version.
Responsive Web Design - Allowing websites to be both desktop and mobile friendly.

Using margin vs padding - Both were great for spacing but margin was giving me less trouble.
