### What I learned

Mobile first workflow - Easier to build with Mobile in mind first then work up to the Desktop version.

Using margin vs padding - Both were great for spacing but margin was giving me less trouble.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - Helped me to look back at syntax I've forgotten, nice and concise.
